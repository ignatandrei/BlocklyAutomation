1. Angular site , ready to be deployed to any server

# You have a site with OpenAPI / Swagger. What should I do  ?

Download from [releases tab](https://github.com/ignatandrei/BlocklyAutomation/releases) the Angular site. Put index.html and all other files into a BLocklyAutomation folder inside your wwwroot  folder ( or in your project root ) and you are good to go.

1. It could be an idea to map everything that start with /BlocklyAutomation to /BlocklyAutomation/index.html - see src\Loaders\SimpleSite to have an C# example 
   
2. Modify assets/settings.json to change the name and the starting blocks
   
3. Modify assets/loadAtStartup/swaggers.json to add your swaggers

4. Modify assets/showUsage/demoBlocks/all.txt to add your demo for the blocks . 
   ( You can construct and then download and save as files)

5. Send me an email to help you  if something  is not working.
## How to customize

To customize the title , introduction and start blocks , see assets/settings.json

To load swaggers at startup, see  assets/loadAtStartup/swaggers.json

To customize demo blocks,download your blocks, put the txt file in  assets/showUsage/demoBlocks/ and modify assets/showUsage/demoBlocks/all.txt
